      <h4> - Rutgers University Students in Cybersecurity</h4>
      <p>
	Welcome to RUSEC. We're an organization of Rutgers students seeking to expand awareness of contemporary cybersecurity issues on campus and throughout the university. We exist to prepare Rutgers students for successful careers in the information assurance and cybersecurity industries. We wish to encourage a dialogue about the crucial role of cybersecurity best practices in other technical fields such as application development and enterprise IT administration. We're also a CTF team.

      <h3>What we're all about</h3>
      <p>
	We compete in CTFs and other cyber security competitions. We do this to hone our skills while further establishing Rutgers as an institution of excellence in cybersecurity. We are working towards providing a hands-on cybersecurity learning environment for Rutgers students, in which experimentation and collaboration are encouraged. We also provide adversarial and preventative security training to Rutgers students.
