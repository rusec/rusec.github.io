## About Us

We are an organization dedicated to preparing Rutgers students for successful careers as
ethical hackers, computer security analysts, and cryptographers. We do this by teaching
students pentesting methodology, vulnerability analysis, and wireless exploitation. One
of our main goals as an organization is to provide deliberately vulnerable machines on
which students can safely and legally practice their skills. We also teach cryptographic
analysis. We also particupate in intramural hacking competitions to provide a means for
students to hone their skills while developing their professional network. We do this
because of the critical need for skilled penetration testers and ethical hackers to 
aid in the ongoing effort secure our infrastructure and industrial assets.
