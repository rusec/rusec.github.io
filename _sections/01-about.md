## About Us

We're an organization of Rutgers students seeking to expand awareness of contemporary cybersecurity issues on campus and throughout the university. We exist to prepare Rutgers students for successful careers in the information assurance and cybersecurity industries. We wish to encourage a dialogue about the crucial role of cybersecurity best practices in other technical fields such as application development and enterprise IT administration.
