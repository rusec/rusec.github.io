      designation : Intructor (Malware Analytics)
      content : My name's Arnav, I am a Computer Science major minoring in Philosophy. My interests within the discipline of cybersecurity lie within reverse engineering/network exploitation, as well as malware analysis. In my spare time, I like to do various CTFs and exploitation challenges on HackTheBox, Over The Wire etc., as well as code small projects of my own for fun. Some of my hobbies outside of CS include playing guitar/making music, watching old movies, playing badminton and buying more games on Steam than I will ever play.
